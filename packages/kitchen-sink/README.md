> See it live at [https://documente.github.io/documente/](https://documente.github.io/documente/)

The Kitchen Sink is a small web application that showcases Documenté features with small example tests.

## Run the tests

Run `npm run test` to:
- start local server
- generate and run tests with Cypress
- generate and run tests with Playwright

You can also run tests on a single runner using the NPM scripts.
For example, to run the tests interactively with Cypress:

```bash
# Start local server in one terminal
npm run start
# Generate and run tests in another terminal
npm run documente:cypress
npm run cypress:open
```
