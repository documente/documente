> 📢 Documente is now [Spequoia](https://github.com/spequoia)!
>
> This repository has been archived.
> Our original idea — human-readable automated tests integrated into documentation — has evolved into something broader and more powerful.
> 
> Spequoia is a new specification format that enables:
> - UI mockups
> - Automated tests
> - Interactive documentation — all from the same spec.
> 
> We’d love for you to join us on the next stage of the journey.
